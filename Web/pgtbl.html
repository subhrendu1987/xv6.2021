<h1>Lab: page tables</h1>

<p> In this lab you will explore page tables and modify them to
  to speed up certain system calls and to detect which pages have been accessed.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 3 of
  the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev2.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and related files:

  <ul>
   <li> <tt>kern/memlayout.h</tt>, which captures the layout of memory.
	  
    <li> <tt>kern/vm.c</tt>, which contains most virtual memory (VM) code.

    <li> <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>, which contains code for allocating and
    freeing physical memory.
  
  </ul>

It may also help to consult the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMFDQC-and-Priv-v1.11/riscv-privileged-20190608.pdf">RISC-V privileged architecture manual</a>.

</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the pgtbl branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout pgtbl</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>

<h2>Speed up system calls <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>
Some operating systems (e.g., Linux) speed up certain system calls by sharing
data in a read-only region between userspace and the kernel. This eliminates the
need for kernel crossings when performing these system calls.  To help you learn
how to insert mappings into a page table, your first task is to implement this
optimization for the <tt>getpid()</tt> system call in xv6.

<div class="required">
When each process is created, map one read-only page at USYSCALL (a VA defined
in <tt>memlayout.h</tt>). At the start of this page, store a <tt>struct
usyscall</tt> (also defined in <tt>memlayout.h</tt>), and initialize it to store
the PID of the current process. For this lab, <tt>ugetpid()</tt> has been
provided on the userspace side and will automatically use the USYSCALL mapping.
You will receive full credit for this part of the lab if the <tt>ugetpid</tt> test
case passes when running <tt>pgtbltest</tt>.
</div>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>
  <li>You can perform the mapping in <tt>proc_pagetable()</tt> in <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.
  <li>Choose permission bits that allow userspace to only read the page.
  <li>You may find that <tt>mappages()</tt> is a useful utility.
  <li>Don't forget to allocate and initialize the page in <tt>allocproc()</tt>.
  <li>Make sure to free the page in <tt>freeproc()</tt>.
</ul>
 
<div class="question">
Which other xv6 system call(s) could be made faster using this shared page?
Explain how.
</div>

<h2>Print a page table <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>
To help you visualize RISC-V page tables, and perhaps
to aid future debugging, your second task is to write a function
that prints the contents of a page table.

<div class="required">
Define a function called <tt>vmprint()</tt>.
It should take
a <tt>pagetable_t</tt> argument, and print that pagetable
in the format described below.
Insert <tt>if(p->pid==1) vmprint(p->pagetable)</tt> in
  exec.c just before the <tt>return argc</tt>,
to print the first process's page table.
  You receive full credit for this part of the lab
  if you pass the <tt>pte printout</tt> test of <tt>make grade</tt>.
  
</div>

<p>
Now when you start xv6 it should print output like this, describing
the page table of the first process at the point when it has just
finished <tt>exec()</tt>ing <tt>init</tt>:

  <pre>
page table 0x0000000087f6e000
 ..0: pte 0x0000000021fda801 pa 0x0000000087f6a000
 .. ..0: pte 0x0000000021fda401 pa 0x0000000087f69000
 .. .. ..0: pte 0x0000000021fdac1f pa 0x0000000087f6b000
 .. .. ..1: pte 0x0000000021fda00f pa 0x0000000087f68000
 .. .. ..2: pte 0x0000000021fd9c1f pa 0x0000000087f67000
 ..255: pte 0x0000000021fdb401 pa 0x0000000087f6d000
 .. ..511: pte 0x0000000021fdb001 pa 0x0000000087f6c000
 .. .. ..509: pte 0x0000000021fdd813 pa 0x0000000087f76000
 .. .. ..510: pte 0x0000000021fddc07 pa 0x0000000087f77000
 .. .. ..511: pte 0x0000000020001c0b pa 0x0000000080007000
  </pre>

The first line displays the argument to <tt>vmprint</tt>.
After that there is a line for each PTE, including PTEs that
refer to page-table pages deeper in the tree.
Each PTE line is indented by a number of <tt>" .."</tt> that indicates its
depth in the tree.
Each PTE line shows the PTE index in its page-table page, the pte bits, and the
physical address extracted from the PTE.
Don't print PTEs that are not valid.  In the above example, the
top-level page-table page has mappings for entries 0 and 255.  The next
level down for entry 0 has only index 0 mapped, and the bottom-level
for that index 0 has entries 0, 1, and 2 mapped.

<p>
Your code might emit different physical addresses than those shown above.
The number of entries and the virtual addresses should be the same.
</p>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>
  <li>You can put <tt>vmprint()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>.
  <li>Use the macros at the end of the file kernel/riscv.h.
  <li>The function <tt>freewalk</tt> may be inspirational.
  <li>Define the prototype for <tt>vmprint</tt> in kernel/defs.h so
    that you can call it from exec.c.
  <li>Use <tt>%p</tt> in your printf calls to print out full 64-bit hex PTEs and addresses as shown in the example.</li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
Explain the output of <tt>vmprint</tt> in terms of Fig 3-4 from the
text.  What does page 0 contain? What is in page 2?
When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory
mapped by page 1? What does the third to last page contain?
</div>

<h2>Detecting which pages have been accessed <script>g("hard")</script></h2>

<p>
Some garbage collectors (a form of automatic memory management) can benefit
from information about which pages have been accessed (read or write). In this
part of the lab, you will add a new feature to xv6 that detects and reports this
information to userspace by inspecting the access bits in the RISC-V page table.
The RISC-V hardware page walker marks these bits in the PTE whenever it resolves
a TLB miss.

 <div class="required">
Your job is to implement <tt>pgaccess()</tt>, a system call that reports which
pages have been accessed. The system call takes three arguments. First, it takes
the starting virtual address of the first user page to check. Second, it takes the
number of pages to check. Finally, it takes a user address to a buffer to store
the results into a bitmask (a datastructure that uses one bit per page and where
the first page corresponds to the least significant bit). You will receive full
credit for this part of the lab if the <tt>pgaccess</tt> test case passes when
running <tt>pgtbltest</tt>.
</div>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>
  <li>Start by implementing <tt>sys_pgaccess()</tt> in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
  <li>You'll need to parse arguments using <tt>argaddr()</tt> and <tt>argint()</tt>.
  <li>For the output bitmask, it's easier to store a temporary buffer in the kernel and copy it to the user (via <tt>copyout()</tt>) after filling it with the right bits.
  <li>It's okay to set an upper limit on the number of pages that can be scanned.
  <li><tt>walk()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt> is very useful for finding the right PTEs.
  <li>You'll need to define <tt>PTE_A</tt>, the access bit, in <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>. Consult the RISC-V manual to determine its value.
  <li>Be sure to clear <tt>PTE_A</tt> after checking if it is set. Otherwise, it won't be possible to determine if the page was accessed since the last time <tt>pgaccess()</tt> was called (i.e., the bit will be set forever).
  <li><tt>vmprint()</tt> may come in handy to debug page tables.
</ul>

<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Use super-pages to reduce the number of PTEs in page tables.

  <li>Unmap the first page of a user process so that dereferencing a
  null pointer will result in a fault.  You will have to start the
  user text segment at, for example, 4096, instead of 0.

  <li>Add a system call that reports dirty pages (modified pages) using <tt>PTE_D</tt>.
