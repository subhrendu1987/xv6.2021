<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> Make sure you pass all of the make
grade tests. If this lab had questions, don't forget to write up your
answers to the questions in answers-<i>lab-name</i>.txt. Commit your changes
(including adding answers-<i>lab-name</i>.txt) and type make handin in the lab
  directory to hand in your lab.

<h3>Time spent</h3>

<p>Create a new file, <tt>time.txt</tt>, and put in it a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab. Don't forget to <tt>git add</tt> and
<tt>git commit</tt> the file.

<h3>Submit</h3>

You will turn in your assignments using
the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2021/handin.py/">submission
website</a>.  You need to request once an API key from the submission
website before you can turn in any assignments or labs.
</p>

<p>After committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>make
handin</kbd> to submit your lab.
<pre>

<kbd>make handin</kbd> will store your API key in <i>myapi.key</i>. If you need
to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If you run <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2021/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
