<h1>Lab guidance</h1>

<h2>Hardness of assignments</h2>
  
<p>Each assignment indicates how difficult it is:
  <ul>
    <li><p><span class="easy">Easy</span>: less than an
    hour. These exercise are typically often warm-up exercises for
    subsequent exercises.</li>
    <li><p><span class="moderate">Moderate</span>: 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li><p><span class="hard">Hard</span>: More than 2 hours. Often these
    exercises don't require much code, but the code is tricky to get
    right.</li>
  </ul>
  These times are rough estimates of our expectations.  For some of
  the optional assignments we don't have a solution and the hardness
  is a wild guess.  If you find yourself spending more time on an
  assignment than we expect, please reach out on piazza or come to
  office hours.
  
<p>The exercises in general require not many lines of code (tens to a
few hundred lines), but the code is conceptually complicated and often
details matter a lot.  So, make sure you do the assigned reading for
the labs, read the relevant files through, consult the documentation
(the RISC-V manuals etc. are on the <a href="../reference.html">reference page</a>)
before you write any code. Only when you have a firm grasp of the
assignment and solution, then start coding.  When you start coding,
implement your solution in small steps (the assignments often suggest
how to break the problem down in smaller steps) and test whether each
steps works before proceeding to the next one.

<div class="warning">
<p>Warning: don't start a lab the night before a lab is due; it much
more time efficient to do the labs in several sessions spread over
multiple days. The manifestation of a bug in operating system kernel
can be bewildering and may require much thought and careful debugging
to understand and fix.

<h2>Debugging tips</h2>

Here are some tips for debugging your solutions:
<ul>
  
  <li><p>Make sure you understand C and pointers.  The book "The C
  programming language (second edition)" by Kernighan and Ritchie is a
  succinct description of C.  Some useful pointer exercises are
    <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/lec/pointers.c">here</a>.
Unless you are already thoroughly versed in C, do not skip or skim the
pointer exercises above.  If you do not really understand pointers in
C, you will suffer untold pain and misery in the labs, and then
eventually come to understand them the hard way.  Trust us; you don't
want to find out what "the hard way" is.
    
  <p>A few pointer common idioms are in particular worth remembering:
<ul>
<li>If <code>int *p = (int*)100</code>, then 
    <code>(int)p + 1</code> and <code>(int)(p + 1)</code>
    are different numbers: the first is <code>101</code> but
    the second is <code>104</code>.
    When adding an integer to a pointer, as in the second case,
    the integer is implicitly multiplied by the size of the object
    the pointer points to.</li>

<li><code>p[i]</code> is defined to be the same as <code>*(p+i)</code>,
referring to the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.
The above rule for addition helps this definition work
when the objects are larger than one byte.</li>
<li> <code>&amp;p[i]</code> is the same as <code>(p+i)</code>, yielding
the address of the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although most C programs never need to cast between pointers and integers,
operating systems frequently do.
Whenever you see an addition involving a memory address,
ask yourself whether it is an integer addition or pointer addition
and make sure the value being added is appropriately multiplied
or not.
  </li>

  <li><p>If you have an exercise partially working, checkpoint your
  progress by committing your code.  If you break something later, you
  can then roll back to your checkpoint and go forward in smaller
  steps.  To learn more about Git, take a look at the
  <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, or, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
  overview of Git</a> useful. </li>
  
  <li><p>If you fail a test, make sure you understand why your code fails
  the test.  Insert print statements until you understand what is
    going on.</li>

  <li><p>You may find that your print statements may produce much output
  that you would like to search through; one way to do that is to run
  <tt>make qemu</tt> inside of <tt>script</tt> (run <kbd>man
  script</kbd> on your machine), which logs all console output to a
  file, which you can then search.  Don't forget to
  exit <tt>script</tt>.
  </li>


  <li><p>In many cases, print statements will be sufficient, but
  sometimes being able to single step through some assembly code or
  inspecting the variables on the stack is helpful.  To use gdb with
  xv6, run make <kbd>make qemu-gdb</kbd> in one window,
  run <kbd>gdb</kbd> (or <kbd>riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb</kbd>) in another
  window, set a break point, followed by followed by 'c' (continue),
  and xv6 will run until it hits the
  breakpoint. (See <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/lec/gdb_slides.pdf">Using
  the GNU Debugger</a> for helpful GDB tips.)
  </li>
  
  <li><p>If you want to see what the assembly is that the compiler
  generates for the kernel or to find out what the instruction is at
  a particular kernel address, see the file <tt>kernel.asm</tt>, which
  the Makefile produces when it compiles the kernel.  (The Makefile
  also produces <tt>.asm</tt> for all user programs.)
  </li>
  
  <li><p>If the kernel panics, it will print an error message listing the
  value of the program counter when it crashed; you can
  search <tt>kernel.asm</tt> to find out in which function the program
  counter was when it crashed, or you can run <kbd>addr2line -e
  kernel/kernel <i>pc-value</i></kbd> (run <kbd>man addr2line</kbd>
  for details).  If you want to get backtrace, restart using gdb: run
  'make qemu-gdb' in one window, run gdb (or riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb) in
  another window, set breakpoint in panic ('b panic'), followed by
  followed by 'c' (continue). When the kernel hits the break point,
  type 'bt' to get a backtrace.
  </li>

  <li><p>If your kernel hangs (e.g., due to a deadlock) or cannot execute
  further (e.g., due to a page fault when executing a kernel
  instruction), you can use gdb to find out where it is hanging. Run
  run 'make qemu-gdb' in one window, run gdb (riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb)
  in another window, followed by followed by 'c' (continue). When the
  kernel appears to hang hit Ctrl-C in the qemu-gdb window and type
  'bt' to get a backtrace.
  </li>

  <li><tt>qemu</tt> has a "monitor" that lets you query the state
  of the emulated machine. You can get at it by typing
  control-a c (the "c" is for console). A particularly useful
  monitor command is <tt>info mem</tt> to print the page table.
  You may need to use the <tt>cpu</tt> command to select which
  core <tt>info mem</tt> looks at, or you could start qemu
  with <tt>make CPUS=1 qemu</tt> to cause there to be just one core.

</ul>

It is well worth the time learning the above-mentioned tools.
